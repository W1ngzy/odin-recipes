    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Zucchini lasagna is an ideal low-carb dinner to satisfy your Italian food
      craving. It's perfect in the summer with garden-fresh veggies and herbs,
      or in the winter when you need a comforting meal. You won't even miss the
      noodles in this one!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Zucchini</strong>: Of course, you’ll need zucchini! Two large
        zucchini should make enough for eight servings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seasonings</strong>: This zucchini lasagna is seasoned with
        salt, pepper, fresh basil, fresh oregano, and fresh parsley.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Beef</strong>: This recipe calls for ground beef, but you can
        use ground turkey for a lighter take.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh Produce</strong>: Aside from the zucchini, you’ll also
        need a green bell pepper, an onion, and mushrooms from the produce
        aisle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frozen spinach</strong>: Frozen spinach is a convenient,
        colorful, and nutrient-rich ingredient.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato products</strong>: A combination tomato paste and tomato
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Wine</strong>: Red wine enhances the overall flavor.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese</strong>: You’ll need low-fat ricotta cheese, mozzarella
        cheese, and Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg</strong>: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the ricotta
        mixture together, preventing runniness.
      </li>
    </ul>
