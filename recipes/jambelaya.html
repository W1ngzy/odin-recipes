    <h3>Method:</h3>
    <div class="method">
      <div class="left">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Season the chicken. In a medium mixing bowl toss together the diced
            chicken with 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning, until evenly coated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the chicken. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large Dutch
            oven or wide-bottomed (and preferably deep) pot over medium-high
            heat. Add the chicken and saute until lightly golden and cooked
            through. Remove the chicken to a plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the sausage. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil along with
            the sausage to the same pan and saute for a couple of minutes, until
            lightly browned on both sides. Remove the sausage to the plate with
            the chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            Saute the veggies. Add the onion, bell pepper, and celery, and saute
            for 4 to 5 minutes, until the veggies have softened. If you need to
            add a splash more oil feel free to do so.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <ol start="5">
          <li>
            Add the garlic and spices. Add the minced garlic, the remaining 1
            tablespoon of Cajun seasoning, and the red pepper flakes to the pan.
            Stir together for 30 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the rice and liquid. Add the rice and toast with the veggies and
            spices by stirring for a minute. Then add the bay leaf, tomatoes,
            and broth. Give it a stir, bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat
            to low, and cover. Cook for about 7 to 8 minutes, stirring
            occasionally just to make sure the rice isn't sticking to the bottom
            of the pot, until the rice is al dente.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the shrimp. Remove the bay leaf, add the shrimp to the pan along
            with the sausage and chicken, gently stir, cover, and turn off the
            heat. The shrimp will cook through in about 4 to 5 minutes, and all
            of the liquid should be absorbed by the rice. Taste the jambalaya
            and season with extra salt and pepper if you'd like.
          </li>
          <li>
            Garnish. Before serving, garnish with sliced green onions and
            chopped parsley.
